# Hi, I'm Sarah Rose 👋

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a passion for building elegant, functional, and user-focused software. Whether it’s weather-based sheep tracking, personal websites from scratch, or teaching others how to code—my goal is always to create projects that **solve real-world problems** and help me grow as a developer.
